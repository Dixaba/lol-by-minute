# lol-by-minute

Small bookmarklet to extract graph data from LeagueOfGraphs match page in spreadsheet-friendly form (as a single column).
Note: not all graphs have per-minute values!

## "Installation"

 1) Open file `bookmark` in this repo in Raw mode.
 2) Create new bookmark in your browser with any name. Set `bookmark` file content as bookmark address.

## Usage

1) Open [LeagueOfGraphs website](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com).
2) Find any summoner you want.
3) Open page with detailed match info.
4) Select needed match participant.
5) Use bookmark you created.
   1) If it's first-time usage - you will need to choose graph you want to extract data from. Just click on any highlighted graph. Your choise will be saved, so you need to choose only once.
   2) If you already selected graph in previous bookmarklet invocation - you will be greeted with huge light rectangle. Click on it to copy data to clipboard. If you need data from another graph - there's "small button" in bottom right corner.
